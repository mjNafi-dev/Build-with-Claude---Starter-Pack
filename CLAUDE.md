# Build-with-AI Starter Pack

This folder is a **reusable starter pack**. The user copies it for every new app project and builds the app with an agentic AI (usually Claude Code). Everything below is standing instruction for the AI working in this folder.

## Two modes — check `meta.js` first

Read `.claude/project/data/meta.js` at the start of every session.

- **`setupDone: false` → TEMPLATE MODE.** The project hasn't started. If the user says "start setup", "let's begin", "new project", or describes an app idea — run the questionnaire in `.claude/setup/questionnaire.md`, exactly as its protocol says (gist first, never the name first). Until setup runs, don't scaffold code.
- **`setupDone: true` → PROJECT MODE.** Normal development. Follow the file map and rules below.

## File map — where to check what

| Path | What it holds | When to touch it |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/project/hub.html` | The Project Hub UI (PRD · Versions · Checklist · Features · Premium · Decisions · Rules). Data lives in the js files, NOT in the HTML. | Restyle once after setup; otherwise rarely. |
| `.claude/project/data/meta.js` | App name, version, pages, platforms, premiumEnabled, setupDone | Version bumps, page list changes |
| `.claude/project/data/prd.js` | The living PRD | Whenever product direction changes |
| `.claude/project/data/versions.js` | `pending` (work done, not yet versioned) + `versions` (the log) | **Add a pending entry after every meaningful change you make.** Promote on "build". |
| `.claude/project/data/checklist.js` | Launch checklist + notes-for-later + phase-2, in sections | "later" items immediately; task progress |
| `.claude/project/data/features.js` | Feature catalog: groups × platforms × status (todo/partial/done/na) + free/premium tier | When features land or get scoped |
| `.claude/project/data/premium.js` | Free/premium split, gating UX, pending monetization decisions | Paywall design changes |
| `.claude/project/data/competitors.js` | Competitor analysis: per-competitor grade, feature table vs. our scope, strengths/weaknesses, verdict | Offered during setup (propose the list first); fill any `requested: true` entry the user adds in the hub |
| `.claude/project/data/decisions.js` | Every questionnaire answer; statuses open/deferred/answered/n-a | During setup + whenever a deferred decision resolves |
| `.claude/project/data/rules.js` | The user-facing rules (mirrors the Rules section below) | Only when the user changes a rule |
| `.claude/creative/design-system.html` | Visual design-system reference (colors, type, spacing, components) | Restyle after setup |
| `.claude/creative/data/design-tokens.js` | The actual token values the design system renders | Whenever the design evolves — the app code must match these |
| `.claude/creative/icons/` | User drops SVGs here for bulk addition to the app | Read when asked to "add the icons" |
| `.claude/shared/sync-engine.js` | Auto-save/live-sync engine for the HTML pages | Almost never |
| `.claude/docs/` | Extra long-form docs (flows, data models, architecture) | See "Where new files go" |
| `the app itself [rename later]/` | ALL app code. Renamed to the app's name during setup. | Constantly |
| `build.bat` (created at setup) | Double-click debug **profile** build | Keep working at all times |

## Data file protocol (critical — the browser syncs live)

Every `data/*.js` file has this exact shape:

```js
window.HUB_DATA = window.HUB_DATA || {};
window.HUB_DATA["<key>"] = /*DATA*/
{ ...valid JSON... }
/*END*/;
```

- The content between `/*DATA*/` and `/*END*/` **must stay valid JSON** (double-quoted keys, no trailing commas, no comments). The hub page parses it with `JSON.parse`.
- The user may have the hub open in a browser **while you edit these files**. The page polls every ~2.5s and picks your changes up automatically — and in Chrome/Edge the page also **writes user edits back to these files**. Therefore: **always re-read a data file immediately before editing it** (it may have changed since you last saw it), and write the whole file in one atomic Write.
- Design tokens use the same pattern with `window.DS_DATA["tokens"]`.

## Rules (the user's standing orders)

These mirror `.claude/project/data/rules.js`. If the user edits rules in the hub, honor the file.

1. **"build"** (or anything meaning *finalize changes and make a debuggable APK/build*):
   1. Promote `pending` → a new version in `versions.js` (ask which segment bumps if unclear), set the new version in `meta.js` **and** in the in-app version constant.
   2. Output the GitHub commit **summary + description**; the description ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` (never include a model name).
   3. Point the user to `build.bat` (debug **profile** build, always, unless the user changes it). Keep the bat current.
2. **"commit"**: output commit summary + description (with the co-author line). Nothing else.
3. **"merge"**: give merge details and the exact steps in the **GitHub Desktop app**. The user handles git through GitHub Desktop — supply text and instructions rather than pushing yourself.
4. **build.bat troubleshooting**: if the user says the build is broken — fix `build.bat` first, also print the full terminal command (with `cd`), and if the root cause can't be found, run the build yourself on the user's behalf.
5. **"later" rule**: any time the user says they'll do/decide something later, add it to `checklist.js` → "Notes for later" **immediately, in the same turn**. Remove items only when truly resolved.
6. **Deferred decisions**: whenever work touches a topic whose decision in `decisions.js` is `open`/`deferred`, re-ask the user — every time, until they decide. When they decide, update `decisions.js` and remove any echo from Notes for later.
7. **Version discipline**: after every meaningful change you make to the app, add a `pending` entry to `versions.js` (with the pages it touched, tagged add/edit/remove). This is what makes "build" promotions accurate.
8. **Competitor analysis**: offered once the app's scope is clear (questionnaire Stage 2.5) — in the same message, propose the competitor list so the user can add/remove names before deciding. If declined, set `enabled: false` in `competitors.js` (tab hides). Any competitor the user adds via the hub arrives with `requested: true` — research and complete it when noticed or when asked to "fill in the competitor analysis". Use web search; grade against OUR planned scope; flag unverifiable vendor claims honestly.
9. **Per-project styling**: the pack ships neutral. After the questionnaire, restyle `hub.html` and `design-system.html` to the app's identity. (Only these HTML shells get restyled — the data files' format never changes.)

## Where new files go

- **Long-form docs** (flows, data model, architecture notes): `.claude/docs/<topic>.md`. One **broad** file per collective topic (e.g. `flows.md`, `data-model.md`) — never one file per small thing.
- **Things the user needs to SEE** (visual references, dashboards): an HTML page following the hub pattern — page in `.claude/project/` or `.claude/creative/`, data in a sibling `data/*.js` file with the `/*DATA*/.../*END*/` contract, wired to `sync-engine.js`. Add a link/mention in the hub if it's central.
- **SVG icons**: user drops them in `.claude/creative/icons/`; you take them from there into the app.
- **App code**: only inside the app folder. If the framework can't share one codebase across OSes, make per-OS subfolders inside the app folder.
- Never scatter loose files at the pack root (exceptions: `CLAUDE.md`, `START HERE.md`, `build.bat`, git files).

## Versioning

- Scheme is `x.y.z`; what each segment means is recorded per-project in `meta.versionMeaning` (asked during setup).
- The version lives in **two** places that must never drift: `meta.js` and the in-app version constant (create it during scaffold; e.g. `lib/version.dart`).
- `versions.js` items support markdown-lite (`**bold**`, `` `code` ``) and page tags `{name, type: add|edit|remove}` — tag pages from `meta.pages`.

## Working style

- The hub (`.claude/project/hub.html`) is the user's single dashboard — keep its data files truthful in the same turn as the work, not "later".
- When the user gives design values, update `design-tokens.js` AND keep the app's theme code in sync with it.
- Uncertain about anything the questionnaire should have answered? Check `decisions.js` before asking again — the answer may already be there.
